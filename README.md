# github_repos_bulk_delete
Quick, but DANGEROUS way to delte multiple github repos
<br>
<br>
Core of this code was generated by ChatGPT.  Made significant edits to make it executable.

# Use Case
I took multiple online courses over the years and was stuck with a large number of their coding repos.
<br>Deleting them serially was tedious.
<br>Used ChatGPT to generate the code stub, made significant edits to make it executable, then used it to bulk-delete the repos.
<br>
<br>
For different use cases, it might be an idea to delete a couple of repos manually, and carefully read the 
<br>
detailed warnings GitHub gives.  This will reduce the risk of indvertently deleting a valuable repo.
