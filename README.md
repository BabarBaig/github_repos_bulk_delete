# github_repos_bulk_delete
Quick, but DANGEROUS way to delte multiple github repos

# Use Case
I took multiple online courses over the years and was stuck with a large number of their coding repos.
Deleting them serially was tedious.
Used this repo to bulk-delete them.
<br><br>
For different use cases, it might be an idea to delete a couple of repos manually, and carefully read
the detailed warnings GitHub gives.  This will reduce the risk of indvertently deleting a valuable repo.
